## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Hello! I am a current senior at Washington and Lee University majoring in Biochemistry with a minor in Data Science. I have completed many projects throughout my data science minor and will be sharing them on this platform. They range from coding Poker in R to a meta-analysis on the best weight loss plan, so feel free to look around!

I am very excited to share my work with everyone and comments would be appreciated!
